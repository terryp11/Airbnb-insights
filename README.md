## Airbnb Insights

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings data in the Boston area to uncover trends and provide actionable recommendations. The analysis includes a deep dive in key factors such as booking trends, revenue, and property features. While the goal is to uncover opportunities for improving booking rates and maximizing revenue through pricing and marketing strategies.

# Project Overview
- Data source: Airbnb listing data in the Boston area. Can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston).

- Tools used: 
    - MySQL
    - Looker Studio
    - Python

- Focus Areas: 
    - Revenue Trends
    - Number of booked days
    - Property features (amenities, location, etc.)

# Key insights
- Amenity access: Found trends showing a possible correlation between certain amenities and higher booking rates. Properties that lacked key ameities often had lower booking rates.
- Booking trends: Identified locations and property types with low booking rates despite having average prices. These properties are potential targets for pricing and marketing adjustments to increase bookings.

# Dashboard
A [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/606a538c-b2c9-4cdb-be8f-dfd160667603) was created with Google's Looker Studio to visualize the following metrics:
- Revenue by neighborhood
- Booked days by neighborhood
- Property amenity impact

# Recommendations
- Amenity Upgrades: Listings without essential amenities like internet, a kitchen, AC, and heating should be recommended to upgrade to increase booking rates.
- Pricing and Marketing Adjustments: Focus marketing efforts and price adjusting towards underbooked but high-potential neighborhoods to improve visibility and attract more guests.

# Future Work
- Expanding Analysis: Looking into other features that can possibly affect booking rates such as property proximity to tourist and popular areas.
